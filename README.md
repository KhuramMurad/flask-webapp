## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/flask-webapp.git
   ```

   Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd flask-webapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   If you prefer running the Flask app locally without Docker, you need to install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application Locally

To run the Flask application locally, use the following command:

```
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser, and you should see the "Hello, World!" message.

### Docker

If you prefer running the Flask app inside a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```
   docker build -t flask-hello-world .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```
   docker run -d -p 5050:5050 flask-hello-world
   ```

   This command will start the Flask application inside a Docker container and expose it on port 5000. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
